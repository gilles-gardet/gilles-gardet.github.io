Redesign of a **Web portal** designed to showcase the various micro-services (APIs), and their documentation, offered by Air France KLM.

As the previous portal was showing limitations with regard to customer needs, a **complete redesign** was ordered, with added functionalities.

The portal's main functions are
- Management of **API consumption keys**.
- Display of **technical documentation**, itself dynamically generated from the API's **Swagger** code
- Creation of content within this documentation via integration of a **CRM** tool
- Management of the degree of API exposure (internal / external / partners...)
- Role management

The project is managed from Amsterdam, but carried out by an Air France team of 4 to 5 developers, plus a *UX Designer*.

Project management based on **Agile (SCRUM)** methods.
