- Development of an **Alfresco content rule** based on the Java language.
  - In order to extract content from an XML archive, copy this content into a **data repository** whose path is deduced from the parsed data in the XML file.
  - The document imported into the Alfresco space is assigned _metadata_ also extracted from the XML file.
  - Redirection\*\* of files that do not meet rule requirements into a new repository, with error logging.
- Development of a tool for reading **RSS feeds** on a liferay Web portal.
  - The tool takes the form of a portlet developed in JSP and Javascript (jQuery) that retrieves a list of feeds in JSON format.
  - The feed is then processed and rendered as HTML content.
  - Cache management is ensured through the use of POST requests managed via an AJAX request architecture.
